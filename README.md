# Microphone Filter
 Simple filtering system to remove cheap microphones constant background voice.

## Motivation of this project
I always have a problem with my microphone. I use a cheap microphone and it has a 
noisy, constant background voice. It is like a noise signal. After what we learned in the 
classes, I decided to make a very simple filtering system to remove my microphones 
background voice.

## Abstract
In this project, I use SIMULINK to achieve my goals. First I record my voice via 
microphone and after that filter the noise as much as possible. In order to filter this signal. I 
look at the FFT of the signal to understand the frequencies. I will mention the steps in this 
project detailly below.
